\begin{itemize}
\item Setup: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If your general is a hero, pick
            a \hyperref[command-traits]{Command Trait}\marginpar{Command Traits
            are passive buffs}
        \item The \textsc{hero} can pick an
            \hyperref[artefacts-of-power]{Artefact of Power} from the
            \hyperref[gifts-of-morathi]{\textsc{Gifts of Morathi}}.
            A \textsc{Wizard} can take an
            \hyperref[artifact-of-shadows]{\textsc{Artifact of Shadow}} and
            a \textsc{priest} can take from the
            \hyperref[relics-of-khaine]{\textsc{Relics of Khaine}}. Pick one
            \emph{additional} artifact for each warscroll battalion.
        \item \emph{Each} \textsc{Wizard} knows one \emph{additional} spell
            from the \hyperref[lore-of-shadows]{Lore of Shadows} and each
            \textsc{priest} one \emph{additional} prayer from the
            \hyperref[prayers-of-the-khainite-cult]{Prayers of the Khainite
            Cult.}
        \item Pick a \hyperref[temple]{temple} to get the temple benefits (and
            the restrictions)
    \end{itemize}

\item Basic troops (Witch Aelves and Sisters of Slaughter) have the ability to
    run and charge with only a musician.  You can reroll 1's to run turn 1, 1's
        to charge turn 2\marginpar{Even improved by
        \hyperref[blood-rituals]{Blood Rituals \textbar{} Warcoven}}, plus Deep
        Striking Khinerai, Khailebron's deep striking ability and Lore of
        Shadows spells that boost movement.
\item Saving Throws:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \hyperref[bloodshield]{Bloodshield} of Cauldron: Add 1 to saving
            throws for friendly \textsc{DoK} units that are wholly within this
            \marginpar{Optimized you can get a +2 on save rolls and re-roll
            save-after-save with 5+ drastically improving the saves}
            range of this model.
        \item \hyperref[witchbrew]{Witchbrew} improves saving throws by 1. Witchbrewed
            units do not take a battleshock test.
        \item \hyperref[fanatical-faith]{Fanatical Faith:} Daughters of Khaine
            can ignore wounds allocated to them on a 6+. Reroll with
            \hyperref[blessing-of-khaine]{Blessings of Khaine}.
        \item \hyperref[blessing-of-khaine]{Blessing of Khaine} allow re-roll
            of failed \hyperref[fanatical-faith]{Fanatical Faith} rolls for that unit
        \item \hyperref[hagg-nar]{Hagg Nar} command trait (passive)
            \hyperref[devoted-disciples]{Devoted Disciples}: Wound is negated
            on 5+ instead of 6+ within 7 inches of general. 
        \item Morathi: \hyperref[enchanting-beauty]{Enchanting Beauty}
        \item Shooting at \textsc{Characters} (\hyperref[corerule:look-out-sir]{Look
            out!}) give the enemy -1 to hit unless the target is a monster.
            Cauldron of Blood \marginpar{Keep them close to a unit and watch
            them get to combat unmolested} or the Bloodwrack Shrine do not
            count as Monsters. 
        \item \hyperref[the-iron-heart-of-khaine]{The Iron Heart of Khaine:
            Morathi}, High Oracle of Khaine cannot be healed, but no more than
            3 wounds can be allocated to her in any one turn. Any additional
            wounds and/or mortal wounds allocated to her in the same turn are
            negated and have no effect.
        \item When \hyperref[war-coven]{War Coven} has been chosen as warscroll: No battleshock tests
            within 18~inch of \textsc{Morathi} due to \hyperref[devout-followers]{Devout
            Followers}
        \item Your enemy gets -1 to hit in the shooting phase against
            Khailebron units
        \item \hyperref[unquenchable-fervour]{Unquenchable Fervour} in phase 5

    \item [\htarget{cursed-blade}{Cursed Blade}] Pick one of the bearerâ€™s melee
        weapons. Add 1 to hit rolls made for that weapon. In addition, each
        time a hit roll of 7+ is made for that weapon, the target suffers
        1 mortal wound instead of the normal damage.
    \item [\htarget{amulet-of-dark-fire}{Amulet of Dark Fire}] Roll a dice each
        time the bearer is allocated a mortal wound that was inflicted by an
        enemy spell. On a 4+ that wound is negated.
    \item [\htarget{crone-blade}{Crone Blade}] Pick one of the bearerâ€™s melee
        weapons. Each time an enemy model is slain by an attack made with this
        weapon, you can heal 1 wound that has been allocated to the bearer.
    \item [\htarget{thousand-and-one-dark-blessings}{Thousand and One Dark
        Blessings}] Add 1 to save rolls for the bearer.
    \item [\htarget{bloodbane-venom}{Bloodbane Venom}] Pick one of the bearerâ€™s
        melee weapons. If a model is allocated any wounds from attacks made
        using that weapon but is not slain, roll a dice after the bearer has
        finished making all of their attacks. If the roll equals or exceeds
        that modelâ€™s Wounds characteristic, it is slain.

\subsubsection{\htarget{artifact-of-shadows}{Artefacts of Shadow}} One
\textsc{hero} can take an artifact of power. \textsc{Wizards} can take an
\textsc{Artifact of Shadows} and \textsc{Priests} can take a \textsc{Relict of
Khaine}.
\begin{description} 
    \item [\htarget{shadow-stone}{Shadow Stone}] Re-roll dice rolls of 1 that
        are made as part of a casting roll for the bearer. In addition, add
        1 to the casting roll if the bearer attempts to cast a spell from the
        Lore of Shadows
    \item [\htarget{rune-of-ulgu}{Rune of Ulgu}] The bearer knows one
        additional spell from the Lore of Shadows 
    \item [\htarget{the-mirror-glaive}{The Mirror Glaive}] Each time the bearer
        unbinds an enemy spell, they can immediately attempt to cast either the
        \hyperref[mystic-shield]{Mystic Shield} or
        \hyperref[arcane-bolt]{Arcane Bolt} spells as if it were your hero
        phase. Your opponent cannot attempt to unbind this spell if the casting
        roll is
        successful.
    \item [\htarget{seven-fold-shadow}{Seven-fold Shadow}] Once per battle,
        instead of moving the bearer in your movement phase, you can remove
        them from the battlefield and set them up anywhere on the battlefield
        more than 9~inch from any enemy models. This is their move for that
        movement phase.
    \item [\htarget{crystal-heart}{Crystal Heart}] The bearer can attempt to
        cast a second spell in each of your hero phases. If they do so, roll
        a dice before the casting roll is made. On a 1, the bearer suffers D3
        mortal wounds.
    \item [\htarget{shade-claw}{Shade Claw}] The bearerâ€™s Whisperclaw has
        a Rend characteristic of -2.
\end{description} 

\subsubsection{\htarget{relics-of-khaine}{Relics of Khaine}}
\begin{description} 
    \item [\htarget{blood-sigil}{Blood Sigil}] The bearer knows one additional

        re-roll rolls of 1 when seeing if the prayer is successful or not.
    \item [\htarget{rune-of-khaine}{Rune of Khaine}] When the bearer is slain,
        roll a dice. On a 1 nothing happens. On 2--5 the unit that slew them
        suffers D3 mortal wounds. On a 6 the unit that slew them suffers D6
        mortal wounds.
    \item [\htarget{crimson-shard}{Crimson Shard}] The bearerâ€™s Blade of Khaine
        has a To Wound characteristic of 2+.
    \item [\htarget{khainite-pendant}{Khainite Pendant}] The bearer can pray
        three times in your hero phase. However, the first time a 1 is rolled

\subsubsection{\htarget{hagg-nar}{\textsc{Hagg Nar}}}
Your general's command trait \emph{must} be Devoted Diciples (passive ability):
\begin{description} 
    \item [\htarget{devoted-disciples}{Devoted Disciples}] (Command Trait)
        Whenever you make a \hyperref[fanatical-faith]{Fanatical Faith} roll
        for a friendly Hagg Nar unit within 7~inch of this general, the
        wound is negated on a 5+ instead of a 6+.  
    \item [\htarget{first-temple}{Daughters of the First Temple}] Whilst a Hagg
        Nar unit is benefitting from the \hyperref[zealots-rage]{Zealot's Rage}
        ability from the Blood Rites battle trait, you can re-roll all failed
        hit rolls for the unit instead of only re-rolling hit rolls of 1.
    \item [Warscroll Building] A Hagg Nar \hyperref[cauldron-guard]{Cauldron
        Guard} battalion can also include 1~Avatar of Khaine or an additional
        \textsc{Cauldron of Blood}
\end{description}
A \textsc{Cauldron of Blood} makes for an exceptional Hagg Nar general, acting
as a lynchpin and force-multiplier for the entire army. The combination of its
\hyperref[bloodshield]{Bloodshield} ability and the
\hyperref[devoted-disciples]{Devoted Disciples} command trait grants your
fragile Daughters of Khaine much-needed protection. Consider the
\hyperref[thousand-and-one-dark-blessings]{Thousand and One Dark Blessings}
artefact for this general too, making a tough model even more resilient. If you
have other battalions, the \hyperref[iron-circlet]{Iron Circlet} or
\hyperref[khainite-pendant]{Khainite Pendant} will ensure your prayers are
answered, and the Avatar of Khaine atop the cauldron can awaken and add its
attacks to the fray. Otherwise, make sure you also have another \textsc{Priest}
or two, such as a Hag Queen. Remember that the \hyperref[wrath-of-khaine]{Wrath
of Khaine} prayer is not one of the six Prayers of the Khainite cult, so can be
attempted by more than one \textsc{Priest} in the same turn (besides, if you
have several Avatars of Khaine, you will need several \textsc{Priest} to awaken
them). That way you can also use the \hyperref[crimson-rejuvenation]{Crimson
Rejuvenation} prayer to mitigate any wounds your general does suffer, and
\hyperref[sacrament-of-blood]{Sacrament of Blood} to ensure your units get the
benefit of their First Daughter of Khaine ability that much quicker. Finally,
if you have any Hagg Nar \textsc{Wizard} in your army,
\hyperref[mirror-dance]{Mirror Dance} is great, as it is able to transport your
general to wherever they are needed the most to protect and boost your troops.
\\

By turn 3 your army is a killing machine and would be already in combat. This is
when things swing dramatically for Hagg Nar. Any unit with just a simple
\hyperref[witchbrew]{witch brew} and being Hagg Nar will be rerolling their
hits and wounds. On a unit of 20 witches that is 80 attacks (reroll hits and
wounds) and if you add \hyperref[mindrazor]{Mindrazor} into the mix no single opponent
can survive that number of paper cuts. 


\subsubsection{\htarget{draichi-ganeth}{\textsc{Draichi Ganeth}}}
If your army includes any Draichi Ganeth \hyperref[slaughter-queen]{Slaughter
Queen's} one must have the artifact \textbf{\htarget{darksword}{The
Darksword}}. This Slaughter Queen's Deathsword has an attacks characteristic
of~4. A Slaughter Troupe may take up to two units of Witch Elves (hitting on
2's, rerolling 1's on turn~3 will make almost every attack hit).\\
\begin{description}
    \item [\htarget{bladed-killers}{Bladed Killers}] Add~1 to hit rolls for Draichi
    Ganeth units in the combat phase if they charged in the same turn.
\end{description}
Draichi Ganeth \hyperref[blood-sisters]{Blood Sisters} are very good
\marginpar{Snake heavy armies take note --- combine with Hag buffs for Crystal
    Vision mortal wounds on 3+, 6's count as two and reroll 1's. That's some scary
    MW output before the sneks start swinging.}
shock-assault units, able to scythe through lesser infantry with ease and slay
tough foes using their crystal touch. They are lethal on the charge, their
Bladed Killers ability allowing you to add 1 to hit rolls for them, meaning
that they can inflict mortal wounds on dice rolls of 3+. They should always be
accompanied by a Draichi Ganeth Slaughter Queen, preferably one on foot so that
she can keep pace with them.  The Catechism of Murder prayer means that any hit
rolls of 6 made for the Blood Sisters inflict 2 hits -- thatâ€™s potentially
2 mortal wounds from each model.  The Slaughter Queen, with her Deathsword, can
then use her Dance of Doom prayer to make up to 8 attacks dealing D3 damage
each. In the next turn, use her Orgy of Slaughter ability on the Blood Sisters
to allow them to fight again, hopefully freeing them up so that they can move
and charge a second unit. They will now perform even better than they did in
the previous battle round because of the extra benefit they will have gained
from the Blood Rites battle trait.

\subsubsection{\textsc{The Kraith}} 
Several units of Kraith Witch Aelves can decimate the enemy, especially when
used alongside a Kraith \textsc{Wizard} who casts Mindrazor. The high number of
attacks that the Witch Aelves can make maximises the damage potential of this
combination, so long as you target units with a lower Bravery characteristic.
Using such a unit alongside a Kraith general with the Zealous Orator command
trait and/or an Avatar of Khaine will mean they will certainly be braver than
any Battleline unit they face. If combined with a second \textsc{Hero} bearing
the Crown of Woe, or a \textsc{Wizard} casting Shroud of Despair, then even
elite units need to beware. The reason this tactic works so well with the
Kraith is their Disciples of Slaughter ability; if after attacking you roll
a 6, then you get to fight with your boosted unit all over again. However, this
unit of Witch Aelves will become a priority target for your opponent â€“ they
will do everything in their power to destroy it before it rampages through
their lines. If a Kraith \textsc{Priest} can use the Martyrâ€™s Sacrifice on the
unit then your opponent has a dilemma: even if they do attack first, thereâ€™s
still a good chance that the Witch Aelves will inflict significant damage in
return.

One Kraith hero must have the artifact Venom of Nagendra:\\
\marginpar{Not as useful as Hagg Nar or Draichi Ganeth (which help you win the
fights you already got into) or Khailebron (which helps you get to the fight in
one piece).} 

\textbf{\htarget{venom-of-nagendra}{Venom of Nagendra}}.  
Once per battle, just before this hero is chosen to fight in the combat phase,
she can use the Venom of Nagendra. When she does so, choose one of her melee
weapons (but not a weapon used by a mount). That weapon's Attacks
characteristic is 1 for the remainder of the phase, but if it hits, the target
suffers D6 mortal wounds instead of the normal damage.\\ 
Cauldron Guard may take any number of Hag Queens and Slaughter Queens. 
\begin{description}
    \item [\htarget{disciples-of-slaughter}{Disciples of Slaughter}] Roll
        a dice after a Kraith unit has fought in the combat phase if there are
        any enemy units within 3~inch of it. On a 6, you can pile in and attack
        with that unit for a second time.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{\textsc{Khailebron}}\label{temple:khailebron}
Whilst deadly at range, Blood Stalkers are vulnerable to any return fire, but
the Khailebronâ€™s Concealment and Stealth ability will help to keep them alive
whilst they slay the enemy from afar. To get even more out of their shooting,
team them up with a PRIEST to use Sacrament of Blood in order to access the
Zealotâ€™s Rage or Slaughtererâ€™s Strength abilities from the Blood Rites table as
soon as possible. Alternatively, use a Khailebron WIZARD to cast the Withering
on your victims and watch that bow fire reap a bloody tally.  If Khailebron
Blood Stalkers are taken as part of a Temple Nest battalion, then to eliminate
the threat they pose your opponent will need to close the distance to negate
their Concealment and Stealth, at which point they are forced into your
Bloodwrack Shrineâ€™s Aura of Agony â€“ which they would otherwise be trying hard
to avoid. If you happen to have Morathi in your army, Blood Stalkers are good
targets for her Worship Through Bloodshed ability, especially on turns 1 and 2,
when they are unlikely to be in combat and Morathi has yet to transform into
the Shadow Queen.

Your enemy gets -1 to hit in the shooting phase against Khailebron units and
your General's command must be Mistress of Illusion.\\
Temple Nest may take to two additional units of Blood Sisters or Blood Stalkers
(or mix). This plugs one of your army's major weaknesses (getting shot to
pieces)\marginpar{Take this against shooting armies} and the Command Trait can
lead to some fascinating tactics, where your opponent never feels safe.
\begin{description}
  \item [Concealment and Stealth] Subtract 1 from hit rolls 
    that target Khailebron units in the shooting phase.
  \item [Warscroll Building] 
    A Khailebron Temple Nest battalion can include up to
    2 additional MELUSAI (Blood Sisters or Blood Stalkers) units.
\item [\htarget{mistress-of-illusion}{Mistress of Illusion}]
    \marginpar{Deepstrike} At the start of your hero phase, you can pick
        a friendly Khailebron unit within 7~inch of this general. If that unit
        is more than 3~inch from any enemy models, remove it from the
        battlefield and then set it up anywhere on the battlefield more than
        9~inch from any enemy models. The unit cannot move in your next movement
        phase.

Morathi can attempt to cast three spells in your hero phase, and attempt to
\marginpar{Three spells, Unbind two.} unbind two spells in the enemy hero
phase. She knows the \hyperref[arcane-bolt]{Arcane Bolt}, Mystic Shield and
Arnzipal's Black Horror spells.  She is adding +1 to her rolls and doubling the
range of her spells.  Her unique spell is
\hyperref[spell:arnzipals-black-horror]{Arnzipals Black Horror} which basically
smacks a unit with a random number mortal wounds.\\ Her 
\hyperref[worship-through-bloodshed]{command ability} allows her to pick two friendly
\textsc{DoK} units within 14~inch and let them make an immediate shooting
attack or allow them to pile in an make a melee attack.\\ \marginpar{Let others

3+/3+/-1/1 damage or D3 damage attacks between her Heartrender and her Bladed
Wings (note she cannot fly though), all the while imposing a -1 to hit when
enemies attempt to swing back at her and she can only take a maximum of three

Morathi \emph{loves} the Khailebron Temple and the Khailebron Temple loves her.

Primary priest, always casting on a 3+ but wounding herself on a 1.
Good buff increasing her meh knife's damage to D3, essentially matching her Deathsword,
which will put the lady at 7 damage D3 attacks, enough to kill bigger units all
on her own. Her other good prayer is the ability to fight twice in the combat
phase, which you should use if she goes up against hordes rather than monsters.
She can also have this ability as a command ability, allowing a friendly unit
to pile in during the hero phase. \\
Leave her at home unless she's your general or you're running Shadowhammer
compact; If you take her as general her command ability makes your Witch
Aelves kill more than what a Hag Queen would do, making her a better option in
this case. \\
One thing to remember is that priests get an extra prayer from the list of
khainite prayers, and therefore can actually pray twice in your hero phase.

attacks, the Bladed Impact rule and gives you the Aura of Agony, which causes

Absolutely essential for turning an assortment of powerful units into

their Crystal Touch attacks, they can throw out a reliable amount of damage

The Crystal Touch is a kicker though, causing an instant mortal wound on every

maximum advantage of the Crystal Touch. The main problem is that they cost
quite a lot for only a few models, yes they have two-wounds each but they are

\end{description}

Your generic Wizard, capable of tossing off a spell that makes it harder for
the enemy to wound you, which is also nice, plus Mindrazor or whatever you
like. Also, you know how Wizards tend to be useless in close combat and
shooting? Well this is Daughters of Khaine and everyone has to pull their
weight. Has an absolutely brutal shooting attack, where you roll a dice for
every model in a unit and every 5+ is a Mortal Wound, and has a metric ton of
close combat attacks, with a theoretical maximum of 16 wounds (average dice
rolls will probably render it closer to 5 or 6, depending on what turn it is).
You already want her slinging spells left and right, and she can easily be used
to quickly clear out a unit of archers or something while your more important
units take out tougher enemies. Definitely needs to be on your list.

A Bloodwrack Medusa can attempt to cast one spell in your hero phase, and
attempt to unbind one spell in the enemy hero phase. It knows the
\hyperref[arcane-bolt]{Arcane Bolt}, \hyperref[mystic-shield]{Mystic Shield}
and \hyperref[spell:enfeebling-foe]{Enfeebling Foe} spells.\\

        unbinding rolls for this unit if it has 10 or more models.
    \item [\htarget{doomfire}{Doomfire}] Doomfire has a casting value of 6. If
        successfully cast, pick an enemy unit within 18~inch of any model in
        the casting unit that is visible to it. The target unit suffers D3
        mortal wounds if the casting unit has fewer than 5 models, D6 mortal
        wounds if it has 5 to 9 models, or 6 mortal wounds if it has 10 or more
        models.
\end{description}

They are excessively fast at 14~inch and they're pretty tough unit of
\textsc{wizards}. This makes them incredibly versatile already, letting you
play small units to either shoot Mortal Wounds or buff your squishy ladies, but
the really great part is their unique spell. First, it's casting value 5, so
very easy to get off, then you get +1 to cast if the unit has 10+ models and
then its a damage spell that scales to your unit size, topping at a flat
6 Mortal Wounds at 10+ models. Six. Mortal. Wounds. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Another way to use them is to ignore their trademark spell and see
        them as a mobile buff support unit. Most time than not \textsc{DoK}
        tends to be a single directed steam roller with not many units to sit
        back and cap objectives. This is where The warlocks comes in, they are
        fast enough to cap and tough enough to stick a little longer vs smaller
        opposing units compared to using harpies for the similar role esp if
        they are within range to the blood shield! To top it off their insane
        14~inch movement allows you to position your warlocks in such a way
        what they can be outside the 30~inch dispel radius from your opponent
        and still in range to buff your own units 
    \item Even though they are \textsc{Cavalry}, there are multiple ways of
        being able to teleport them into the face of your opponent on turn 1.
        Taking a \hyperref[shadowpaths]{Shadow Patrol} with two units of 10
        Warlocks and a General with the Khailebron Command Trait
        \hyperref[mistress-of-illusion]{Mistress of Illusion} can do just this.
        That is 6 Mortal Wounds plus 40 4+/4+/-/1 Crossbow shots, and whatever
        spells you loaded onto the second unit hitting your opponent at once.
\end{itemize}
A unit of Doomfire Warlocks can attempt to cast one spell in your hero phase,
and attempt to unbind one spell in the enemy hero phase. A unit of Doomfire
Warlocks knows the \hyperref[arcane-bolt]{Arcane Bolt},
\hyperref[mystic-shield]{Mystic Shield} and Doomfire spells.

        more than 9~inch from any enemy models. This is their move for that
        movement phase.
    \item [\htarget{fight-and-flight}{Fight and Flight}] In the combat phase,
        after this unit has finished making all of its attacks, roll a dice: on

    \item [Heartpiercer Shield] In the combat

        addition, each time you make a save roll of 6 for such a unit in the

        a Khinerai Lifetaker pierces her assailantâ€™s heart with her shield
        -- the attacking unit suffers 1 mortal wound after it has made all of
        its attacks.
\end{description}

Lifetakers behave pretty much like flying Witch Aelves. They gain +1 damage
whenever they charge into combat and can also fall back from combat after they
have completed all of their attacks on a die roll of 4+, so you can escape
during an enemy turn and just charge them again on your own. Get enough of
these together and they'll be taking anything down.

two 80 point units rather than your 300 point blobs of Witch's and Sister's.
Anyways, if you get something to bite, let them charge you, then

your Allied Assassin's on him/her and decide where to go from there.}

The other of your two new Khinerai Harpy units. The Heartrender variant are
your ranged specialists who can fling their barbed javelins up to 12~inch doing
decent 3+/3+/-1/1 damage; although that's only one attack each.  They can Deep
Strike, arriving anywhere on the table more than 9~inch from the enemy when you
feel like, which is still happily within their shooting range, which also has
their Rend characteristic boosed to -2 for that alpha strike attack.  They can
also shoot after running and fall back after shooting on a die roll of 4+,
meaning that although 12~inch is quite a short range for a ranged weapon you
have a chance of darting in and out an inevitable counter-charge when the enemy
gets annoyed with you. They also have the Heartpiercer Shield which makes them
more resilient though admittedly you don't want this unit in melee because they
do so much better as a harassing unit. \\

Heartrenders can also serve as line backers, able to move and support your
units where needed. Use this when faced against armies that put out more
damage than they can handle, sitting them behind your hordes of
Witches/Sisters to take the brunt of your opponents abuse and chucking
Javelins at them then moving into combat to mop up whatever is left. \\

\subsubsection{Command Traits}
Only your general has this, but you can choose what is cheesiest/fluffiest/Your
dudes-est or roll. Beware that if you have to choose a new general for whatever
reason, you have to roll. 
\begin{description}
    \item{Strategic Genius} At the start of the first battle round, you
        receive 1 extra command point. strong options for first turn
        shenanigans with 2 command points at your disposal.
    \item{Inspiring} Friendly ORDER units at 6 inch doesn't roll battleshock. If
        you expect heavy casualties, this trait is great, as it doesn't make
        a potentially bad situation worse. But be wary of becoming
        a DISTRACTION CARNIFEX and shot to death.
    \item{Reckless} Reroll charge of the general. If you have a melee
        powerhouse of a general (and Order has a few candidates), go ahead
    \item{Tenacious} +1 wound. Nice, but donâ€™t get overconfident. A squishy
        wizard is still a squishy wizard, either with 5 or 6 wounds.
    \item{Legendary Fighter} +1 attack to a chosen melee weapon each combat
        phase. Depending on the hero, this can be shit or awesome.
    \item{Defense Master} Ignore wound and mortal wounds on 6+. Somewhat
        disappointing, but an additional save always is nice.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Artifacts}
A HERO in your army can have one of these for free, and for each Batallion, you
include you can choose an additional HERO to carry another one.

\begin{description}
\item{Quicksilver Potion} Once per battle, you and your mount can attack
    before anyone, even in your opponent's turn. This can be potentially nasty
        in the right hands. Sure, a Freeguild General can't do much (you'll be
        surprised), but it's another story in a Lord Celestant on Dracoth or
        Stardrake or a Dreadlord. A good trick is to deliberately put them in
        charge distance from a nasty but manageable unit and drink it in the
        enemy's combat phase to take them for surprise and crush them.
\item{Obstinate Blade} -1 Rend to one of your melee weapons. Always useful. If
    you're not sure which artifact to take, this one is always a good option.
        Remember that a Rend -4 is usually overkill with the average saves out
        there, a -2/3 is way better if you have around 4~5 attacks with the
        said weapon.
\item{Relic Blade} +1 Damage to one of your melee weapons. As with the
    Obstinate blade, useful. Prioritize this if you know that your hero is
        going to face many multi-wound models, like cavalry or elite infantry.
\item{Hoarfrost} Choose one of your melee weapons, anyone who is wounded but
    survives, suffers -1 to Hit for the rest of the battle. This can be
        situational, but characters who rely on a flurry of attacks but are
        almost naked, like the Assasin or the Death Hag can be a lifesaver.
\item{Talisman of Blinding Light} Once per battle at the start of the combat
    phase, -1 to Hit to all who targets its bearer. Don't. There are better
        artifacts that do almost the same that last longer, like Hoarfrost, or
        better suited for defense, like the Phoenix Stone. And that's if you
        want to go defensive.
\item{Phoenix Stone} Heal 1 wound each friendly hero phase. Really good, even
    if somewhat underwhelming. That wound saved can be the difference between
        alive or dead, or a holy deliverer of the Pantheon's fury or a clawless
        newborn kitty. Combine with abilities or spells which heals like Lord
        Relictor's or Collegiate Life Battlemage's to great effect.
\end{description}

\section{Strategies and Tactics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use \hyperref[fanatical-faith]{Fanatical Faith} and \hyperref[martyrs-sacrifice]{Martyr's Sacrifice} on units that engage battle. If equipped with shields each unit that gets removed from the board potentially deals up to two mortal wounds.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deployment}
If you have fewer drops than your opponent, you will always be able to decide
who takes the first turn. With most games, the first turn is a blessing. Not so
much in Age of Sigmar.

The player that takes the second turn will have a chance to get a double turn.
However, optimize the gameplan that you can get a double turn on round three as
blood rites start to kick in then.

If it is not up to you to decide who takes the first turn, you can try to force
the hand of your opponent with your set-up. Do this by deploying aggressive,
forcing them to take the first turn or suffer heavy casualties and lose
objectives. Make sure you do this without overextending yourself.

\subsection{Threat range} The most important thing to consider when deploying
is how far all units can charge and shoot after one movement phase. This is
called the threat range.

\subsection{Charge} By destroying units on the alpha strike after charging, you
can deal massive damage each turn without having the strength of the unit
diminished.

All units you activate after the alpha strike will suffer one or more enemy
activations.  there are only four reasons to charge with a unit.

Units that have charged are always allowed to pile in 3 inch even if there is
no enemy in range. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item If the unit can win the fight and open up a charge in their next
        turn.
    \item If the unit can deal damage while suffering fewer casualties during
        their opponentâ€™s activation.
    \item If it is the only way to prevent enemy unit(s) from moving to
        a better target or capturing an objective in the opponents turn(s).
    \item If the unit can capture an objective.
    \item Units that have charged are always allowed to pile in 3 inch even if
\end{itemize}

Optimizing your Charge move:
\begin{itemize}
    \item When you charge a unit with a single model, you have a clear range
        advantage. While you only need to be in contact with one model, your
        opponent needs to be in range with every model that attacks.
    \item Enemy models may not pile in when they are already in contact with an
        enemy model. Use this to prevent the closest enemy models from making
        room for its buddies by moving around you.
\end{itemize}
